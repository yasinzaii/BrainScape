description: |
  This dataset: Active Escape Task (activeescape)
  
  69 participants tracking an 18-second countdown and making time-sensitive motor responses under the threat of electric shock.
  
  - Shock intensity (mild vs unpleasant) and controllability were manipulated.
  - In "controllable" trials, participants could avoid shocks if motor responses were fast enough.
  - In "uncontrollable" trials, a shock was always received.
  - Task design creates controllable-mild, uncontrollable-mild, controllable-unpleasant, and uncontrollable-unpleasant conditions.
