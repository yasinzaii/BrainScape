# SoCal Kinesia and Incentivization for Parkinson's Disease (SKIP): Active Escape

## Description

This dataset: Active Escape Task (activeescape)

69 participants tracking an 18-second countdown and making time-sensitive motor responses under the threat of electric shock.

- Shock intensity (mild vs unpleasant) and controllability were manipulated.
- In "controllable" trials, participants could avoid shocks if motor responses were fast enough.
- In "uncontrollable" trials, a shock was always received.
- Task design creates controllable-mild, uncontrollable-mild, controllable-unpleasant, and uncontrollable-unpleasant conditions.
