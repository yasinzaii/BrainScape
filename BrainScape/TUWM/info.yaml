title: Tidying Up White Matter: Neuroplastic Transformations in Sensorimotor Tracts following Slackline Skill Acquisition

description: |
  This longitudinal intervention study investigated the influence of a 2-3 weeks slackline training on white-matter plasticity. 60 subjects were randomly assigned to either the slackline-intervention (SG) group or to a control group (CG). For each participant, we acquired MR-data of 3 time points, including a high-resolution T1 and a multi-shell diffusion dataset (including reverse phase encoding direction). For the SG, the measurement took place for the training (TP1) directly after the 2-3 weeks intervention (TP2) and the 3 weeks afterwards (TP3). Participants in the CG were investigated following the same time table.
