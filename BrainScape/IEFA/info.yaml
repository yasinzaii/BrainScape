title: Isometric exercise facilitates attention to salient events in women via the noradrenergic system

description: |
  Subject folders are labeled by their experiment id (e.g., "sub-101, sub-201, sub-301"). Subjects in the 100 series are LU (luteal phase younger women); 200 series are HC (hormonal contraceptive younger women); and 300 series are PM (post-menopausal older women).

  Contained within the anat and func sub-folders for each subject are the following acquisitions (with a few exceptions described below):

  1. anat (2 acquisitions) - T1-weighted anatomical image, T1 FSE (neuromelanin-weighted) image of the pontine brainstem slices

  2. func (2 to 3 acquisitions) - Isometric Handgrip functional scan, Oddball task functional task (run 1), Oddball task functional scan (run 2, if acquired)
