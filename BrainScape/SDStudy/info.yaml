title: "Speech disfluencies: Neurophysiological aspect in normal population"

description: |
  This dataset is a part of a project aimed at the analysis of neural mechanisms of speech disfluencies, signals controlling the communication flow. Objectives of the current project include revealation and differentiation of the circuitry underlying comprehension of speech disfluencies from the various classes of the linguistic taxonomy. The dataset currently includes resting-state fMRI as well as structural MRI data for 81 healthy participants (mean age 24, 50 females, 31 males).
