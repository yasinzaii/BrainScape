title: Structural (t1) images of 136 young healthy adults

description: |
  The dataset contains structural T1-weighted magnetic resonance brain imaging data from 136 young individuals (87 females; age range from 18 to 35 years old) along with questionnaire-assessed measurements of trait-like chronotype, sleep quality and daytime sleepiness. The recruitment criteria excluded individuals with self-reported history of psychiatric or neurological conditions and current medication use. All the brain imaging sessions were performed between 5:20 PM and 8:55 PM in order to control the effect of time of day on acquired images. The data is mostly useful to scientists interested in circadian rhythmicity. It can be deployed in large-scale multicenter meta-analyses investigating the structural brain correlates of chronotypes in humans. Additionally, the data could be of use in investigations into the effects of sleeping habits and latitude on brain anatomy.
