# The 1000 Functional Connectomes Project

## Description

The "1000 Functional Connectomes" Project has announced the unrestricted public release of over 1,200 "resting state" functional MRI (R-fMRI) datasets, independently collected across 33 sites. These datasets were generously donated by principal investigators from member sites to provide the broader imaging community with comprehensive access to a large-scale functional imaging resource. Each dataset includes information on age, sex, and imaging center. In accordance with HIPAA guidelines, all datasets are anonymized and contain no protected health information. This data-sharing initiative is expected to equip researchers with the tools necessary to explore and refine R-fMRI methodologies and to foster the growing ethos of sharing and collaboration within the scientific community.
