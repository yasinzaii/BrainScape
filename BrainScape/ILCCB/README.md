# An fMRI dataset for investigating language control and cognitive control in bilinguals

## Description

The neural correlation between language control and cognitive control in bilinguals remains an area ripe for further exploration. In this work, we present a functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) dataset that simultaneously examines both types of control in 77 healthy, unrelated Chinese-English bilinguals. Each participant completed a language switching task to assess language control and a rule switching task to evaluate cognitive control while undergoing functional MRI scanning. We collected structural imaging data, task-related functional imaging data, and behavioral data from the participants. Additionally, their language proficiency and domain-general cognitive ability were recorded after the scanning. This dataset was released early to facilitate the exploration of the neural relationship between language control and cognitive control, promoting its broader use and benefiting the scientific community. It is well-suited for the study of causality analysis, representational similarity analysis and the prediction model construction.
