title: Unexplained Repeated Pregnancy Loss is Associated with Altered Perceptual and Brain Responses to Men's Body-Odor

description: |
  functional: Each subject has two functional scans, separated by T1 anatomical scans. Each functional scan started with a 4-sec emotional clip (to be excluded in the analysis as in the preprocessing we skip the first 8 TRs), and next 12-sec-long video clips were presented: 20 clips of high emotional content and 20 landscape clips, in alternating order, with an ITI (fixation point) of 8-12 sec. Following each video clip, participants were asked to rate their emotional arousal, on a scale of 1 to 8, with 8 being the highest. Simultaneously with each video clip, body-odor or blank were delivered using a computer-controlled air-dilution olfactometer that embedded the odorant pulse within a constant stream of clean air at 1.5 liter per minute. The two functional scans were identical except for the odor content. The two conditions (blank vs. stranger body-odor) were counterbalanced for order between participants. Participants were aware of the possibility of an odor being delivered, but were not told when.
