title: "fMRI Investigations of Individual Differences on Memory Activation for Faces and Words: The Effects of Handedness and Phenomenal Experience"

description: |
  
  **NOTE**: All T2 MRIs are dropped - Incomplete/cropped images.

  fMRI dataset exploring the effect of individual differences such as handedness and phenomenal experience on memory encoding and retrieval activity for faces and words.
  
  **Participants:**

  A total of **120 participants** were recruited from the university and nearby community. All participants self-reported being free of neurological or psychiatric diagnoses and met safety inclusion criteria for MRI scanning (e.g., screening for implanted medical devices).

  Participants were originally recruited for a study on the impacts of handedness on memory function (handedness analyses reported elsewhere). Consequently, **61 participants** were excluded from the present analyses due to left-handedness (Edinburgh Handedness Inventory Scores<40).

  **Exclusion Criteria:**

  Further exclusions included:
  - **7 participants** due to excessive motion in the MRI scanner
  - **2 participants** due to low response rates in the memory task (nonresponses>2 Standard Deviations above the mean)
  - **1 participant** due to being a notably strong outlier for cognitive bias score (-3.9 Standard Deviations below the mean)

  The final data analyses were performed with **n = 49** (25 male; 24 female, mean age = 23.1, range 18 to 48).
