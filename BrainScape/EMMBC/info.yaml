title: Evaluating methods for measuring background connectivity in slow event-related fMRI designs

description: |
  fMRI task where participants passively viewed blended face stimuli (nine faces total). A resting-state scan was complete prior to the passive viewing task.

  Task order: rest, expo_run-1, expo_run-2, expo_run-3, expo_run-4

  Information related to the task for each trial (onsets, duration of stimulus on the screen, category-relevant and category-irrelevant faces that constitute each blend) are included in a _events.tsv file for each subject and each run of the training task.

  **NOTE:** Ignoring T2 MRIs as the brain is cropped.
