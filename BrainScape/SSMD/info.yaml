title: SixthSense

description: |
  The current dataset includes the fMRI data from 57 participants who watched a shortened version of The Sixth Sense movie (~60 minutes) and recalled the movie scenes (both parts were scanned). There were 3 conditions. In one group, participants learned about the twist at the beginning of the movie ("spoiled group", condition = 1 in subj_info.txt fie). The second group watched the movie and the twist came at the end of the movie ("twist group", condition = 2 in subj_info.txt fie). The third group watched the movie but did not watch the twist at the end of the movie and did the recall naive to the twist information ("no twist group", condition = 3 in subj_info.txt fie).
