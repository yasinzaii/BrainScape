# Deciphering the neural responses to a naturalistic persuasive message

## Description

Fifty healthy participants listened to a persuasive healthy eating call during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Before and after the narrative, they performed a bidding task, which determined which participants were persuaded by the healthy eating call and which were not.

For more information, see the paper at https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2401317121. This fMRI study is the continuation of our previous behavioral (https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.926875/full) and EEG (https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/behavioral-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2023.1147140/full) studies with a similar experimental design.
