# Listening task

## Description

We tested 82 participants aged 19-81. All reported themselves to have normal hearing, to be right handed, and not have a history of neurological disease. Because the task involved spoken language, all were native speakers of American English.

Participants were randomly assigned to control (no motion feedback) or intervention (real-time motion feedback) groups.
