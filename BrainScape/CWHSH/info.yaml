title: "Can we have a second helping? A replication study on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying self-control"
  
description: |
  Here, 80 participants (40 females, mean age 24.94 years; age range 18-43 years) completed this experiment, which was conducted in the Netherlands. After adjusting the group definition criteria (see details below), 15 participants qualified as SC (group) based on their food choices during the scanner task (9 female, mean age = 25.4, range = 20-34, mean BMI = 22.22, SD = 2.50) and 65 for as NSCs group (31 female, mean age = 24.83, range = 18-43, mean BMI = 22.89, SD = 2.64). SC and NSC groups did not differ significantly in gender distribution (chi(1) = 0.328, p = .567), age (t(78) = -0.399, p = .691) or BMI (t(77) = 0.897, p = .373). A power analysis, employing the fMRI power package (Mumford & Nichols, 2008), can be found in the preregistration.
