title: "The Dallas Lifespan Brain Study"
  
description: |
  The Dallas Lifespan Brain Study (DLBS) is a longitudinal multi-modal neuroimaging study of the aging mind, which was initiated in 2008 (referred to as Wave 1). Participants returned for two additional waves of data collection with an approximate interval of 4-5 years between waves. The DLBS protocol encompasses various imaging modalities, including structural MRI, diffusion MRI, and functional MRI, as well as comprehensive cognitive and psychosocial assessments. Additionally, amyloid and tau PET imaging were performed as part of the study. This data set was among the pioneering long-duration longitudinal studies that investigated MRI metrics related to brain aging, PET biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease, and cognition across the entire adult lifespan (ranging from ages 20-90). Moreover, it was one of the earliest cognitive aging studies to include in vivo measurement of tauopathy using PET imaging with radiotracer AV-1451, also known as flortaucipir.

  For detailed information on the data acquisition methods employed in the DLBS, please refer to our comprehensive document titled "Keys to the Kingdom". Methodological references are also included at the end of this document.

  **Individual Differences Measures:**

  Individual differences measures for this sample are included in the participants.tsv and participants.json files. Key measures include age, sex, years of education, ethnicity, race, and the time interval between waves of data collection (in years).

  Unavailable data points in participants.tsv are reported as "NA". Scores for participants that did not return for that wave are entered as "xx". 

  
  **MRI Notes:**

  Five dummy volumes were discarded at scan time to allow for T1 stabilization. Some participants had a second MPRAGE or FLAIR acquisition due to motion artifacts in their first scan. Participants with second MPRAGE run by wave: wave 1 (752), wave 2 (4868), wave 3 (208, 503, 557, 684, 688, 772, 1093, 1245)
  Participants with second FLAIR run by wave: wave 1 (754, 779, 2872, 3693), wave 2 (196, 200, 2127, 2133), wave 3 (12, 934, 988, 1767, 2872, 4315)
