This dataset is a pilot study supported by the Scientific Research Network on Decision Neuroscience and Aging. The full dataset is described in a submission to Scientific Data.

- sub-2xx participants do not have imaging data because these individuals were the friends of the respective sub-1xx participants. For example, sub-204 was the participant outside the scanner playing the role of the investee while sub-104 was the participant inside the scanner playing the role of the investor
- The derivatives folder contains subfolders for fmriprep and mriqc outputs. The derivatives folder also contains single-trial estimates and tnsr images.
- All code related to this dataset can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/DVS-Lab/srndna-datapaper). This includes sourcedata for the scanner tasks and also stimulus presentation scripts.
- For convenience, the code and stimuli subfolders of the GitHub repository have been copied to this dataset.
