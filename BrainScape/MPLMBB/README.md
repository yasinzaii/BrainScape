# The MPI-Leipzig Mind-Brain-Body dataset

## Description

The MPI-Leipzig Mind-Brain-Body dataset contains MRI and behavioral data from 318 participants. Datasets for all participants include at least a structural quantitative T1-weighted image and a single 15-minute eyes-open resting-state fMRI session.

The participants took part in one or two extended protocols: Leipzig Mind-Body-Brain Interactions (LEMON) and Neuroanatomy & Connectivity Protocol (N&C). The data from LEMON protocol is included in the ‘ses-01’ subfolder; the data from N&C protocol in ‘ses-02’ subfolder.

LEMON focuses on structural imaging. 228 participants were scanned. In addition to the quantitative T1-weighted image, the participants also have a structural T2-weighted image (226 participants), a diffusion-weighted image with 64 directions (228) and a 15-minute eyes-open resting-state session (228). New imaging sequences were introduced into the LEMON protocol after data acquisition for approximately 110 participants. Before the change, a low-resolution 2D FLAIR images were acquired for clinical purposes (110). After the change, 2D FLAIR was replaced with high-resolution 3D FLAIR (117). The second addition was the acquisition of gradient-echo images (112) that can be used for Susceptibility-Weighted Imaging (SWI) and Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM).
