title: "Cerebrovascular Reactivity Normative Dataset"
  
description: |
  Fifty healthy adult subjects with no prior history of neurological or psychiatric disorder were included in this dataset.

  The goal is to provide a normative dataset for the computation of maps of Cerebrovascular Reactivity Maps. For this purpose, we developed CVRmap, a BIDS-compatible pipeline to process the data. More information on CVRmap can be found on the corresponding github page:

  `www.github.com/ln2t/cvrmap`.

  The paper describing CVRmap and this dataset can be found [here](https://rdcu.be/dCCZW).

  **Rawdata**

  - Anatomical data: a standard T1w image was acquired for each subject.
  - Functional data: each subject underwent an fMRI scan with blocs of CO2 inhalation challenges.
  - Physiological data: breath CO2 was recorded using a capnograph during the fMRI acquisition.
