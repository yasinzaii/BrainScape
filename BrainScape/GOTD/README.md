# Game of Thrones - A naturalistic viewing dataset

## Description

This dataset contains fMRI movie-watching and category localiser data in 28 developmental prosopagnosics and 45 neurologically healthy controls. Participants are additionally grouped by their familiarity with the Game of Thrones television series.

In movie-watching scans, participants passively viewed a series of short audiovisual clips (ranging from 50 to 117 s duration; total duration = 12 min 58 s) taken from the Game of Thrones television series.
