title: Sympathovagal quotient and functional connectivity of control networks are related to gut Ruminococcaceae abundance in healthy men

description: |
  We characterized the gut microbiota genera and families related to the heart rate variability (HRV) and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC), their interaction effect over the gut microbiota taxa abundance, and the mediation effect of diet in these relationships in eighty-eight healthy Colombian men in a cross-sectional study.
