description: |
  A total of 104 adults participated in this study (62 females, mean age=19.30, SD=1.44, range: 18-26). Participants were first year undergraduate students from UCLouvain Faculty of Psychology (n=50) and Faculty of Motor Sciences (n=54). All participants provided written informed consent to the experimental procedure, which was approved by the institutional review boards of Ghent University and the University of Luxembourg. All participants were right-handed, with normal or corrected-to-normal vision. Participants were advised to avoid drinking alcohol 24h prior to participation in the scanning session. Participants received a fixed amount of 45 euros as compensation for participation. All brain imaging sessions (N=104) occurred in October 2021.
