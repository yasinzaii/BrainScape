title: "Differentiation of functional networks during long-term memory retrieval in children and adolescents"
  
description: |
  fMRI data of long-term memory retrieval in children (aged 10-12), adolescents (aged 14-16), and young adults (aged 20-35 years).
  
  The paradigm is based on Burianov√°, H., Grady, CL. (2007). Common and unique neural activations in autobiographical, episodic, and semantic retrieval. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 19(9), 1520-34. https://doi.org/10.1162/jocn.2007.19.9.1520
