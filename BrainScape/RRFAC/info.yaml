title: Reading-related functional activity in children with isolated spelling deficits and dyslexia


description: |
  This dataset contains the raw 3 Tesla fMRI data and T1 structural images of 58 children: 22 children with typical reading and spelling skills, 16 children with isolated spelling deficits (SpD) and 20 children with dyslexia. This dataset was used for the paper " Reading-related functional activity in children with isolated spelling deficits and dyslexia", which was published in Language, Cognition and Neuroscience (doi: 10.1080/23273798.2020.1859569). Stimuli consisted of 60 words and 60 matched pseudohomophones of three to eight letters. Each stimulus was presented alone in white on a black background for 3s in an event-related design. After it disappeared, a fixation cross was displayed. The presentation of the fixation cross was jittered between 2000 and 6000 ms (M = 4000 ms). To prevent fatigue effects in children, stimuli were presented over three consecutive runs of 40 items each, separated by short breaks of 3-5 min. Children were instructed to read aloud the stimuli appearing on the screen.
