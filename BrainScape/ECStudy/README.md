# The Energetic Costs of the Human Connectome

## Description

This dataset consists of quantitative FDG-PET, BOLD-fMRI, and DWI data from 30 right-handed, 
healthy individuals, acquired during rest on a Siemens Biograph mMR 3T PET-MR scanner from 
three independent cohorts:

1. The raw data and derivatives of a within-subject exploration cohort (TUM.exp) with nine participants 
  acquired across two sessions, one with their eyes open and the other with their eyes closed (participants 
  s003 to s026; mean age = 43 years, std = 7 years; 4 females).

2. The raw data and derivatives of a prospective replication cohort (TUM.rep) with eleven participants 
  acquired with their eyes open (participants s028 to s038; mean age = 27 years, std = 5 years; 6 females).

3. The derivatives of an external within-subject replication sample (VIE.rep) (Sundar et al., 2018) of 
  ten participants acquired with their eyes open (participants HC002 to HC014; mean age = 27 years, std= 7 
  years; 5 females). Two participants from the VIE.rep cohort had only one session.
