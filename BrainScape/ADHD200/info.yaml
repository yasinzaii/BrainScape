title: "ADHD-200"
  
description: |
  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects at least 5-10% of school-age children and is 
  associated with substantial lifelong impairment, with annual direct costs exceeding $36 billion/year 
  in the US. 
  
  Despite a voluminous empirical literature, the scientific community remains without a comprehensive 
  model of the pathophysiology of ADHD. Further, the clinical community remains without objective biological 
  tools capable of informing the diagnosis of ADHD for an individual or guiding clinicians in their decision-making 
  regarding treatment.

  The ADHD-200 Sample is a grassroots initiative, dedicated to accelerating the scientific community's 
  understanding of the neural basis of ADHD through the implementation of open data-sharing and discovery-based 
  science. 
  
  Towards this goal, we are pleased to announce the unrestricted public release of 776 resting-state fMRI 
  and anatomical datasets aggregated across 8 independent imaging sites, 491 of which were obtained from 
  typically developing individuals and 285 in children and adolescents with ADHD (ages: 7-21 years old). 
  
  Accompanying phenotypic information includes: diagnostic status, dimensional ADHD symptom measures, age, 
  sex, intelligence quotient (IQ) and lifetime medication status. Preliminary quality control assessments 
  (usable vs. questionable) based upon visual timeseries inspection are included for all resting state fMRI scans.

usage_agreement: | 
  Consistent with the policies of the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project, data usage is unrestricted 
  for non-commercial research purposes. We kindly request that the specific datasets included in analyses 
  be specified appropriately, and that their funding sources be acknowledged. As per INDI protocol, we simply 
  require that users register with the NITRC and 1000 Functional Connectomes Project to gain access.
