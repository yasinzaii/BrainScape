  File descriptions:

  - 18 subjects that listened to Story1 "milky_audio.wav" (sub-01 to sub-18)
  - 18 subjects that listened to Story2 "vodka_audio.wav" (sub-19 to sub-36).
  - 18 subjects that listened to both Story1_synonyms "synonyms.wav" and Story2_scrambled "scrambled.wav" (sub-37 to sub-54).
  
  The scan included: 18 seconds of music, 3 seconds of silence, and then the story started. At the end of the story there were 15 seconds of silence. As the TR was 1.5 seconds, the story actually started at TR=15, and ended at TR=283. This is true for all the subjects, except sub-18 and sub-27 who started at TR=11 and ended at TR=279 (due to trigger issues in the scanner).
