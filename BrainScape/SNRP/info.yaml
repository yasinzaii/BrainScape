title: An fMRI dataset of social and nonsocial reward processing in young adults

description: |
  The sourcedata directory contains the subdirectory 'redcap'. This subdirectory contains .txt files that includes all collected behavioral data, including data for participants who do not have fMRI data.

  We note that 6 out of 59 participants are missing the childhood trauma questionnaire short form, questionnaire of unpredictability in childhood, and the social experience questionnaire. These questionnaires were to be completed during a followup survey, but were not completed by these participants.

  Code related to this dataset can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/DVS-Lab/ISTART-DataInBrief). This includes sourcedata for the scanner tasks and file generation scripts.
