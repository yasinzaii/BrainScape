title: "The impact of handedness on the neural correlates during kinesthetic motor imagery: a FMRI study"

description: |
  STUDY DESCRIPTION: To the best of our knowledge there is no study directly investigating the difference between right and left handers MI neural correlates per se and especially in the cerebellum. To achieve a deeper understanding of handedness effects on motor imagery in both right and left-handed individuals, the present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare neural correlates associated with the execution and imagination of a simple task (i.e., squeezing a ball) with the dominant, non-dominant and both hands.

  DATASET DESCRIPTION: In the present dataset you can find: - participants.tsv: document with the information reagarding sex, age, handedness, and questionnaires results of all the 51 subjects included. - task-execution_acq-Fs2_bold.json: Information regarding the execution task - task-imagery_acq-Fs2_bold.json: Information regarding the imagery task - sub-108TUSW01100n: folder for each participant, where n is the number associated to the participant (from 1 to 51), including ses 1 folder with the anatomical (anat folder); functional map (fmap folder) and functional data (func folder) for each subject.
