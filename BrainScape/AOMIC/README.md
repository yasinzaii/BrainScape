# Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC) - AOMIC-ID1000

## Description

The ID1000 dataset is part of the Amsterdam Open MRI Collection (AOMIC), a collection of multimodal 
(3T) MRI datasets including structural (T1-weighted), diffusion-weighted, and (resting-state and task-based) 
functional BOLD MRI data, as well as detailed demographics and psychometric variables from a large 
set of healthy participants.

This dataset contains both raw and preprocessed data (and other "derivatives"), which is available on 
[Openneuro](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003097).

The contents of this dataset are described in detail in [this preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.155317v1). 
More general information about the AOMIC datasets, including instructions on how to download (parts of) it,
