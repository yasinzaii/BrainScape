## Description

Narratives: fMRI data for evaluating models of naturalistic language comprehension

The "Narratives" collection aggregates auditory story-listening fMRI datasets acquired over the course of roughly seven years (2011â€“2018). Stimuli comprised 28 naturalistic spoken stories ranging from ~3 to ~56 minutes for a total of ~5 hours of unique audio stimuli. The collection includes 345 unique subjects participating in over 750 functional scans with accompanying anatomical data. This re-release of the dataset follows on ds002245 v.1.0.3 and fixes some issues with cropped and redundant T1w anatomical images.
