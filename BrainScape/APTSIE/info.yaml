  This dataset contains the fMRI data used for the study: "Representation of social content in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex underlies individual differences in agreeableness trait", Arbula S., Pisanu E., Rumiati I. R., Unpublished

  Fifty-five participants were presented with short animations representing different shapes that moved randomly or interacted in a socially meaningful way. Each animations lasted 20 s. During each of the 4 runs 5 different animations were presented interleaved with 15 s long fixation blocks. After each animation, participants had to indicate by pressing a key if according to them the shapes were moving randomly or interacted as if they were taking into consideration each other feelings and thoughts. A third key could be pressed if they were not sure about the type of interaction. Each run consisted of 2 or 3 videos of each condition. One social and one random video were presented prior to scanning for practice and were not reused during the testing phase.

  Data from 6 participants were classified as outliers based on the following quality metrics: AFNI's outlier ratio and quality index, intensity changes (DVARS) and frame-wise displacement (FD). A full report of image quality metrics is available in derivatives.
