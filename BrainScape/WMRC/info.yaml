title: Working Memory and Reward in Children with and without Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)

description: |
  This experiment was implemented in E-prime following the design described in the task-_bold.json files as well as illustrated in stimuli/task_design.jpg

  **Sessions**

  At ses-T1 subjects competed standardized testing (located in phenotype/) as well as imaging sessions. At ses-T2 subjects only completed standardized testing.

  **Defacing**

  Anatomical images were defaced according to procedure described in Lytle, McNorgan, & Booth (2019) (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-019-0338-5)
