# Exploring the Resting State Neural Activity of Monolinguals and Late and Early Bilinguals

## Description

All imaging was performed on a 3T Siemens TIM Trio MRI scanner (Erlangen, Germany) using a 32-channel head coil at the BYU MRI Research Facility. Each participant contributed a structural MRI scan and a resting-state functional MRI scan. Structural scans used a T1-weighted MP-RAGE sequence with the following parameters: TR = 1900ms; TE = 2.26ms; acquisition matrix: 215 × 256; field of view = 218 × 250mm; slice thickness = 1.0mm; voxel size =.977 × .977 × 1.0mm; flip angle = 9°; and number of slices = 176; GRAPPA factor = 2. Resting state fMRI scans were performed using a T2*-weighted EPI sequence with the following parameters: TR = 875ms; TE = 43.6ms; slice thickness = 1.8mm; acquisition matrix = 100 × 100; flip angle = 55°; number of slices = 72; field of view = 180 × 180mm; voxel size = 1.8 × 1.8 × 1.8mm; multi-band factor = 8; volumes per run = 823 (total scan time = 12min). EPI scans were oriented parallel to the long axis of the hippocampus. All MRI scans were imported from DICOM to NIfTI file format using program dcm2nii (v. 1JUNE2015; http://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricron/). As part of the file conversion process, structural scans were reoriented to the nearest orthogonal using rigid-body transformation and extraneous field of view was cropped.
