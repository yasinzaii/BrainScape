title: Transdiagnostic Connectome Project

description: |
  A richly phenotyped transdiagnostic dataset with behavioral and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data from 241 individuals aged 18 to 70, comprising 148 individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for a broad range of psychiatric illnesses and a healthy comparison group of 93 individuals.

  These data include high-resolution anatomical scans and 6 x resting-state, and 3 x task-based (2 x Stroop, 1 x Faces/Shapes) functional MRI runs. Participants completed over 50 psychological and cognitive questionnaires, as well as a semi-structured clinical interview.

  Data was collected at the Brain Imaging Center, Yale University, New Haven, CT and McLean Hospital, Belmont, MA. This dataset will allow investigation into brain function and transdiagnostic psychopathology in a community sample.
