title: The NIMH intramural healthy volunteer dataset

description: |
  Note: The Mapping Creates 2 Groups for some of the Subjects. 

  The Second Group Just has an extra flair image. 

  Note: Regex Mapper divides Data based on 
  Sub -> Ses -> Type Which usually have their own directories. 

  Then if there are 2 or more MRI of a modality falling in the same directory they are divided into group. 


  For this particular dataset I want to ignore the second group.


  This setting:

  "mapFirstGroupOnly": true,

  will only MAP first Group with group index 0. 


  The remaining groups will be ignored.
