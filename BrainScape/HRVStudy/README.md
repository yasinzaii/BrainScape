# Heart rate variability biofeedback training and emotion regulation

## Description

Previous research suggests that heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback aimed at increasing HRV can reduce anxiety and stress. The current project investigated the brain mechanisms underlying these effects, with the primary hypothesis being that inducing high amplitude heart rate oscillations via slow paced breathing and HRV biofeedback would increase functional connectivity within brain emotion-related networks, including between amygdala and mPFC. The effects of two 5-weeks interventions were compared: 1) Increase-Oscillations (Osc+), in which participants completed two daily sessions involving slow paced breathing and HRV biofeedback aimed at increasing heart rate oscillation; 2) Decrease-Oscillations (Osc-), in which participants completed two daily sessions involving individualized strategies and HRV biofeedback aimed at decreasing heart rate oscillation.

Study design: Study Type : Interventional (Clinical Trial) Actual Enrollment : 193 participants Sessions: 2 MRI sessions and 2 HRV data (lab biofeedback calibration data as the third "session" and home practice data as the forth session). The study also involved multiple lab visits. Allocation: Randomized Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment Intervention Model Description: Participants were randomly assigned to either the HRV-increase group or the HRV-decrease group. Masking: Single (Participant) Primary Purpose: Basic Science Official Title: Why Does Heart Rate Variability Matter for Emotion Regulation Actual Study Start Date: February 14, 2018 Actual Primary Completion Date : March 13, 2020 Actual Study Completion Date : May 5, 2020
