# Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange II - ABIDE II

## Description

The establishment of ABIDE I demonstrated the feasibility and utility of aggregating MRI data across sites. 
However, the complexity of the connectome, along with the substantial heterogeneity of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) 
and initial results from ABIDE I data analyses underscore the need for even larger and better-characterized samples. 

Accordingly, with support of an award from the National Institute of Mental Health (R21MH107045), ABIDE II was 
established to further promote discovery science on the brain connectome in ASD. To date, ABIDE II has aggregated 
over 1000 additional datasets with greater phenotypic characterization, particularly in regard to measures of core ASD 
and associated symptoms. 

In addition, two collections include longitudinal samples of data collected from 38 individuals at two time points (1-4 year interval). 
To date, ABIDE II involves 19 sites - ten charter institutions and seven new members - overall donating 1114 datasets from 521 individuals 
with ASD and 593 controls (age range: 5-64 years). These data have been openly released to the scientific community on June 2016. 

In accordance with HIPAA guidelines and 1000 Functional Connectomes Project / INDI protocols, all datasets are anonymous, 
with no protected health information included.

**Note:**

These two patterns are also exclued in subject name:

-  "ONRC_*",
- "*_baseline",


## Usage Agreement

Consistent with the policies of the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project, data usage is unrestricted 
for non-commercial research purposes. We kindly request that the specific datasets included in analyses 
be specified appropriately, and that their funding sources be acknowledged. As per INDI protocol, we simply 
require that users register with the NITRC and 1000 Functional Connectomes Project to gain access.
