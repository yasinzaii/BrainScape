# Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange I - ABIDE I

## Description

The Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange I (ABIDE I) represents the first ABIDE initiative.

Started as a grassroots effort, ABIDE I involved 17 international sites, sharing previously 
collected resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI), anatomical, and phenotypic 
datasets made available for data sharing with the broader scientific community. 

This effort yielded 1112 datasets, including 539 from individuals with ASD and 573 from typical controls 
(ages 7-64 years, median 14.7 years across groups). This aggregate was released in August 2012. Its establishment 
demonstrated the feasibility of aggregating resting state fMRI and structural MRI data across sites; 
the rate of these data use and resulting publications (see Manuscripts) have shown its utility for capturing 
whole brain and regional properties of the brain connectome in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

In accordance with HIPAA guidelines and 1000 Functional Connectomes Project / INDI protocols, all 
datasets have been anonymized, with no protected health information included.


## Usage Agreement

Consistent with the policies of the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project, data usage is unrestricted 
for non-commercial research purposes. We kindly request that the specific datasets included in analyses 
be specified appropriately, and that their funding sources be acknowledged. As per INDI protocol, we simply 
require that users register with the NITRC and 1000 Functional Connectomes Project to gain access.
