  A comprehensive dataset for the data included in the manuscript entitled “Multivariate Assessment of Inhibitory Control in Youth: Links with Psychopathology and Brain Funciton”. This dataset contains demographic variables, parent-reported clinical symptoms, behavior from four canonical cognitive function neuropsychological tests, along with structural and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data.

  Participants included youth ages 8 - 18 years. To be eligible for the study, participants needed to be able to read, speak, and understand English and meet diagnostic criteria for either a primary diagnosis of an anxiety disorder (generalized, social, and/or separation anxiety disorder), disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), or ADHD. In addition, youth were included with clinically-significant irritability not meeting the threshold for DMDD (ie. significant irritability but only in one setting) and youth with no psychiatric diagnosis (as assessed by a clinical using the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime version (KSADS-PL). Participants were excluded for: IQ<70; diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, past and/or current posttraumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, or major depression; substance use within the past three months; and neurological disorder. Parents and youth completed written informed consent and assent, respectively. Families received monetary compensation. 

  Of the 246 participants included in analyses, only 220 consented to share their data publicly. Thus, exact replication of analyses from this manuscript will not be possible.
