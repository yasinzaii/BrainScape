# Multi-echo simultaneous multislice fMRI dataset: Effect of acquisition parameters on fMRI data

## Description

The dataset was created for the purpose of evaluation of multi-echo fMRI at various levels of acceleration (SMS or MB factors) and flip angles. It is suitable for testing and optimization of data processing pipelines and comparing characteristics of single-echo and/or multi-echo data for various acquisition settings.
