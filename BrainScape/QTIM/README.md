# Queensland Twin IMaging (QTIM)

## Description

We present the Queensland Twin IMaging (QTIM) dataset: a multimodal neuroimaging dataset of young adult twins and siblings (18-30 years, N = 1026), including a subsample of participants, scanned a second time to assess test-retest reliability (N = 78, test-retest interval ~ 3.5 months). The QTAB dataset additionally includes adolescent twins scanned at age 12 (N = 88) or 16 (N = 88) years. Approximately a third of these 12- and 16-year-old participants were scanned four years later as part of a longitudinal pilot study (scanned at 12 and 16 years N = 24, scanned at 16 and 20 years N = 38).
