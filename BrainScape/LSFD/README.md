# Large-scale fMRI dataset for the design of motor-based Brain-Computer Interfaces

## Description

Full description of the data in our dataset paper: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.29.24311044

This dataset is part of the PANDA project. PANDA aims at attesting the feasibility of implanted communication Brain-Computer Interface (cBCI) technology to establish communication in children with severe physical impairments, such as due to CP. This was supported by the Dutch Technology Foundation STW.
