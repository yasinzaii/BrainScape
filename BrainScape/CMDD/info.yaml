title: "Cortical myelin measured by the T1w/T2w ratio in individuals with depressive disorders and healthy controls"
  
description: |
  The dataset is a part of the ongoing longitudinal study (R01MH114870 to Anna Manelis). The current dataset includes T1w, T2w, and spin echo fieldmaps for the participants who were scanned and passed QA by January 2021. A more detailed description of the study participants and procedures as well as the preprint of the associated manuscript can be found here https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.25.21252472v2

  All participants but one (ID: 719313) have baseline scans (ses-01). ID: 719313 was diagnosed with MDD during the course of the study and thus changed the diagnostic status (i.e., converted) from control to case. This individual was not included into the main analyses, but was used in the exploratory analysis that predicted the diagnostic status of this individual at baseline and 6-months follow-up from the model trained on all other participants in the study.
