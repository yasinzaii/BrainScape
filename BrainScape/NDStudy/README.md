# Functional magnetic resonance imaging data for the neural dynamics underlying the acquisition of distinct auditory categories

## Description

Sixty adult Mandarin native speakers were recruited for the fMRI experiment. They were assigned to either the RB (n = 30, 19 females) or II (n = 30, 22 females) learning task. Each task consisted of six training blocks where each consisting of 40 trials
