# Cognitive Control Theoretic Mechanisms of Real-time fMRI-Guided Neuromodulation (CTM)

## Description

**Participants:**

Participants were right-handed (assessed by Edinburgh Handedness Inventory) native born United States citizens (control for IAPS image self-report) who were medically healthy and exhibited no current Axis I psychopathology, including mood disorders, as assessed by the SCID-IV clinical interview. All participants reported no current use of psychotropic medication and produced a negative urine screen for drugs of abuse (cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamines, marijuana, opiates, and benzodiazepines) immediately prior to the MRI scan. Participants also produced a negative urine screen prior to SCID-IV clinical interview. When necessary, participants' vision was corrected to 20/20 using an MRI compatible lens system. Participants endorsing color blindness were excluded.

**Study Design:**

The study was performed over two separate sessions, each occurring on separate days. During Session 1, participants provided written informed consent, received screening for clinically relevant exclusionary criteria via structured clinical interview, and completed behavioral surveys and questionnaires. Neuroimaging and concurrent psychophysiological measurements were recorded during Session 2. Neuroimaging consisted of a T1-weighted scan, 2x Identify task fMRI scans, 1x Resting State task fMRI scan, and 2x Modulate task fMRI scans. The relevant task descriptions are elaborated below.

**Data Collection**

We acquired all imaging data using the same Philips 3T Achieva X-series MRI scanner (Philips Healthcare, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) with a 32-channel head coil. We acquired anatomic images using an MPRAGE sequence (matrix = 256 x 256, 220 sagittal slices, TR/TE/FA = 8.0844/3.7010/8°, final resolution =0.94 x 0.94 x 1 mm3). We acquired functional images using the following EPI sequence parameters: TR/TE/FA = 2000 ms/30 ms/90°, FOV = 240 x 240 mm, matrix = 80 x 80, 37 oblique slices, ascending sequential slice acquisition, slice thickness = 2.5 mm with 0.5 mm gap, final resolution 3.0 x 3.0 x 3.0 mm3.
