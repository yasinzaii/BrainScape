description: |
  This data release of 117 healthy community-dwelling adults provides multimodal high-quality neuroimaging and behavioral data for the investigation of brain-behavior relationships. We provide structural MRI, resting-state functional MRI, movie functional MRI, together with questionnaire-based and task-based psychological variables; many of the participants have multiple datasets from retesting over the course of several years. Our dataset is distinguished by utilizing open-source data formats and processing tools (BIDS, FreeSurfer, fMRIPrep, MRIQC), providing data that is thoroughly quality checked, preprocessed to various extents and available in multiple anatomical spaces. A customizable denoising pipeline is provided as open-source code that includes tools for the generation of functional connectivity matrices and initialization of individual difference analyses. Behavioral data include a comprehensive set of psychological assessments on gold-standard instruments encompassing cognitive function, mood and personality, together with exploratory factor analyses. The dataset provides an in-depth, multimodal resource for investigating associations between individual differences, brain structure and function, with a focus on the domains of social cognition and decision-making.
