# Cognitive Training

## Description

Each participant completed a resting scan, ITC task, and risky choice task. In ITC task, they were shown a large delayed monetary option on the screen, and they were asked to either accept that offer or to reject it and opt for $20 immediately, In risky choice task, they were shown a large risky monetary option on the screen, and they were asked to either accept that offer or to reject it and opt for $20 with certainty. They used their two thumbs to indicate accept/reject.

**Note:** The low quality T2 images are not dropped because the Spatial Resolution (voxel size) info is passed along with the dataset JSON.
