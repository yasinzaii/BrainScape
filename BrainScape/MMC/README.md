# Magic, Memory, and Curiosity (MMC) fMRI Dataset

## Description


* The Magic, Memory, Curiosity (MMC) dataset contains data from 50 healthy human adults incidentally encoding 36 videos of magic tricks inside the MRI scanner across three runs.
* Before and after incidental learning, a 10-min resting-state scan was acquired.
* The MMC dataset includes contextual incentive manipulation, curiosity ratings for the magic tricks, as well as incidental memory performance tested a week later using a surprise cued recall and recognition test .
* Working memory and constructs potentially relevant in the context of motivated learning (e.g., need for cognition, fear of failure) were additionally assessed.
