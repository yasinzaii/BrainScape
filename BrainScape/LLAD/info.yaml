title: Language Learning Aptitude dataset

description: |
  In this study, brain structural correlates of LLAMA test scores were explored. The dataset includes T1-weighted, PD-weighted (used to mitigate B1 inhomogeneities and eliminate PD-weighted and T2* effects), and two sets of diffusion weighted images (one single-shell with high angular resolution and one multi-shelled).
