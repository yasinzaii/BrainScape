# Training of loss aversion modulates neural sensitivity toward potential gains

## Description

Sixty human participants completed the behavioral paradigm in the MRI scanner (31 females, 29 males; age range: 18 - 30 with mean 22.9-year-old). Two participants were discarded from the brain imaging analyses; one due to a missing anatomical image, and the other due to excessive head movement (more than one-third of the volumes were considered "bad time points" according to the motion correction procedures detailed in the Preprocessing section).
