title: A naturalistic paradigm to investigate post-encoding neural activation patterns in relation to subsequent voluntary and intrusive recall of distressing events

description: |
  The experiment, consisting of three sessions, combined the trauma film paradigm with fMRI scanning, and the completion of a diary to record the daily frequency of intrusive memories over a week. During session 1 six film clips previously shown to elicit a high number of intrusive memories were presented. Clips depicted scenes involving actual or threatened death or serious injury. Each clip was approximately one minute and followed by a 5-minute rest period. After the encoding phase, an additional 6-minute resting-state scan was acquired during which participants pressed a button if an image of the film popped into their minds. At the end of session 1 participants were given a pen-and-paper diary to record any intrusive memories of the films for the following week. Instructions were similar to previous studies (e.g., Lau-Zhu, Henson & Holmes, 2019), defining intrusive memories as mental images from the film clips ("pictures in your mindâ€™s eye") that occurred spontaneously, i.e., came to mind unbidden. Approximately 24 hrs after session 1 participants returned for session 2, and were shown brief written descriptions to help them retrieve 3 out of 6 film clips. Session 3 took place in a laboratory 7-8 days after session 1 and started with voluntary memory recall tests, i.e., (cued) free recall, and verbal and visual recognition, followed by an intrusion provocation task. In addition, several self-report measures were administered across the three days.
