# Le Petit Prince Hong Kong - Naturalistic fMRI and EEG dataset from older Cantonese speakers

## Description

In the field of neurobiology of language, existing research predominantly focuses on data from a limited number of Indo-European languages and primarily involves younger adults, overlooking other age groups. This experiment aims to address these gaps by creating a comprehensive multimodal database. The primary goal is to advance our understanding of language processing in older adults and the impact of healthy aging on brain-behavior relationships.

The experiment involves collecting task-based and resting-state fMRI, structural MRI, and EEG data from 52 healthy right-handed older Cantonese participants over 65 years old as they listen to excerpts from "The Little Prince" in Cantonese. Additionally, the database includes detailed information on participants’ language history, lifetime experiences, linguistic and cognitive skills, as well as extensive audio and text annotations, such as time-aligned speech segmentation and prosodic features, along with word-by-word predictors from natural language processing (NLP) tools. Quality diagnostics of the MRI and EEG data confirm their robustness, positioning this database as a valuable resource for studying the spatiotemporal dynamics of language comprehension in older adults.

**METHOD:**

We recruited 52 healthy, right-handed older Cantonese participants (40 females, mean age=69.12, SD=3.52) from Hong Kong for the experiment, which consists of an fMRI and an EEG session. In both sessions, participants listened to the same sections of The Little Prince in Cantonese for approximately 20 minutes. We made sure each participant was right-handed and a native Cantonese speaker using the Language History Questionnaire8 (LHQ3). Additionally, participants reported normal or corrected normal hearing. They confirmed they had no cognitive decline. Two participants did not take part in the fMRI session and an additional 4 participants’ fMRI data were removed due to excessive head movement, resulting in a total of 46 participants (39 females, mean age=69.08yrs, SD=3.58) for the fMRI session and 52 participants (40 females, mean age=69.12yrs, SD=3.52) for the EEG session. Prior to the experiment, all participants were provided with written informed consent. All participants received monetary compensation after each session. Ethical approval was obtained from the Human Subjects Ethics Application Committee at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (application number HSEARS20210302001). This study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and all other regulations set by the Ethics Committee.
