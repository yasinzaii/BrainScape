# The heterogeneity in retrieved relations between the personality trait 'Harm avoidance' and gray matter volumes due to variations in the VBM and ROI labeling processing settings

## Description

95 healthy female volunteers (age: 18-30 years) were recruited to participate in the study. All underwent a T1 weighted anatomical scan of the head (TI/TR/TE=940.4/7.6/3.7ms, flip angle=8°, FOV=240x240x200mm³, resolution=1x1x2mm³) at a Philips 3T Achieva MRI scanner.
