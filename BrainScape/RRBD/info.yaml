title: Relationship between resting state functional connectivity and reading-related behavioural measures in 69 adults

description: |
  This study investigated the neural correlates of specific reading subprocesses by examining the temporally correlated activity of the VWFA with other brain regions during rest. Analysing RSFC data from 69 typical adults, we found that VWFA activity correlated with multiple left hemisphere regions known for print-to-sound or print-to-meaning translation during reading. Our results revealed that performance on phonological tasks, particularly spoonerisms and spelling, showed significant positive correlations with RSFC between the VWFA and dorsal IFG. However, tasks hypothesised to tap lexical-semantic processes did not show the anticipated relationships. Specifically, no substantial correlation was found between VWFA RSFC and ventral brain regions when related to behavioural performance. This study underscores the involvement of dorsal stream regions in phonological output processes but poses questions on the involvement of the ventral stream in lexical-semantic processes in reading. Future research may benefit from a multi-indicator approach to reduce behavioural data noise and offer clearer insights.
