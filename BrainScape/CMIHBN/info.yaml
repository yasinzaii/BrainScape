description: |    
  Innovations in methods and technologies are equipping researchers with unprecedented capabilities for detecting and characterizing pathologic processes in the developing human brain. As a result, there is growing enthusiasm about the prospect of access to clinically useful tools that can assist in the diagnosis and management of mental health and learning disorders. For these ambitions to be realized, it is critical to accrue large-scale multimodal datasets that capture a broad range of commonly encountered clinical psychopathology. To this end, the Child Mind Institute launched the Healthy Brain Network in 2015, an ongoing initiative focused on creating and sharing a data resource comprised of data from at least 10,000 New York City area children and adolescents (ages 5-21). The Healthy Brain Network utilizes a community-referred recruitment model.

  The Healthy Brain Network stores and openly shares de-identified data about psychiatric, behavioral, cognitive, and lifestyle (e.g., fitness, diet) phenotypes, as well as multimodal brain imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), digital voice and video recordings, genetics, and actigraphy.
