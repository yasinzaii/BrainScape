\section*{Data and Code Availability}

All code and configuration files used to implement and run the BrainScape framework 
are publicly available on GitHub at 
\url{https://github.com/yasinzaii/BrainScape} under the MIT License. 
Since BrainScape automatically integrates publicly available MRI data from multiple open repositories, 
no single ``BrainScape dataset'' is distributed. 
For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the README file or contact the authors for further clarification.
