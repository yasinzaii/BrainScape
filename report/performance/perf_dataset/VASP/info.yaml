title: Visual and audiovisual speech perception associated with increased functional connectivity between sensory and motor regions

description: |
  We collected data from 65 adults aged 18-34 years. Of these, we excluded fMRI data from 5 participants. The remaining 60 participants ranged in age from 18-34 years (M = 22.42, SD = 3.24). All were right-handed. Where available, pure-tone thresholds are given for the left and right ear (L_250 = threshold for left ear at 250 Hz in dB, and so on).
